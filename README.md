# Health Diagnosis System

I've developed a healthcare diagnosis assistant that enables users to input their symptoms and receive real-time disease predictions. This intuitive system harnesses the power of natural language processing and machine learning to offer quick, reliable healthcare guidance.

## Tech Stack

The project is built using the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Programming Languages:**
  - Python 🐍

- **Machine Learning Libraries:**
  - Scikit-learn 🧠
  - Gensim 🤖
  - TensorFlow (optional) 
  - PyTorch (optional) 


- **Data Processing Libraries:**
  - pandas 🐼
  - numpy 🔢
  - nltk 📚


- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes (used for symptom-to-disease prediction) 🩺


- **Deployment:**
  - Hugging Face Spaces (for model hosting) 🚀
  - Streamlit (for creating the web application) 🌐
## Features

- Early Detection: Users receive early warnings about possible medical conditions based on their symptoms
- Symptom Analysis: The system analyzes user-entered symptoms to predict potential diseases.

## Future Improvements

- **Medication Recommendations:** I plan to integrate a medication recommendation system, providing users with information on suggested medications and first-aid measures for their predicted diseases.

- **Conversational Experience:** My future goal is to create a more interactive experience using natural language processing and chatbot capabilities. Users will be able to have in-depth conversations, receive detailed explanations, and get answers to their health-related questions.
